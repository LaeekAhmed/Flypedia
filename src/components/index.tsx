/*
The components/index.tsx file is typically used as an entry point for exporting and organizing reusable components.
It allows you to import multiple components from a single file, simplifying the import statements in other parts of your application.

This way, instead of importing each component individually, you can import them all from components:
import { Header, Footer, Sidebar, Button } from '../components';

This organization helps in managing and maintaining the components in a cleaner and more structured way.
